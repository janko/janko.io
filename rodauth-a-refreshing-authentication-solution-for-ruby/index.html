  <div class="mt-6 sm:mt-8 markdown">
    <p>If you’re working with Rails, chances are your authentication layer is
implemented using one of the popular authentication frameworks – <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery">Sorcery</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance">Clearance</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">Authlogic</a>. These libraries provide complete
authentication and account management functionality for Rails, giving you more
time to focus on the core business logic of your product.</p>

<p>One characteristic these authentication frameworks have in common is that
they’re all built on top of Rails. This means that they plug into the existing
Rails components (models, controllers, routes), and generally try to follow
“The Rails Way” of doing things.</p>

<p>However, libraries that build on top of Rails often tend to inherit some of
Rails’ <em>anti-patterns</em> as well, such as having high coupling, burdening models
and controllers with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">additional responsibilities</a>, and overusing Active
Record callbacks. Having had my fair share of experience with the Ruby
ecosystem outside of Rails’ <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#omakase">default menu</a>, I’ve come to learn that
taking the effort to make your library’s implementation <strong>decoupled from
Rails</strong> can provide significant advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breaking away from Rails gives you mental space to design your library better</li>
  <li>your library can now be used with other Ruby web frameworks too <img class="emoji" title=":innocent:" alt=":innocent:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f607.png" height="20" width="20">
</li>
  <li>supporting new Rails versions becomes easier too</li>
</ul>

<p>If one wanted to implement authentication in another Ruby web framework, the
most frequent advice seems to be to use <a href="https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden">Warden</a>. Warden is a Rack-based
library that provides a mechanism for authentication, with support for multiple
strategies. However, the problem is that Warden doesn’t actually <em>do</em> anything
by itself. You still need to implement login, remembering, registration,
account verification, password reset and other functionality yourself (which is
what Devise does), and I’d argue <em>this</em> is actually the hard part <img class="emoji" title=":sweat:" alt=":sweat:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f613.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="enter-rodauth">Enter Rodauth</h2>

<p>We’ve actually had a better solution for some time now, it just hasn’t received
enough attention. Jeremy Evans – a <a href="https://rubyheroes.com/heroes/2015">Ruby Hero</a>, a Ruby
committer, and an author of numerous Ruby libraries (most popular of which is
<a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda">Roda</a>) – has been developing a new full-featured authentication
framework for the past several years, called <strong><a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/rodauth/">Rodauth</a></strong>. Recently I’ve
finally had the opportunity to integrate Rodauth into a Rails app at work, and
I can safely say that its tagline – <em>“Ruby’s most advanced authentication
framework”</em> – is in no way exaggerated <img class="emoji" title=":ok_hand:" alt=":ok_hand:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44c.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>One of the first things you’ll notice is that, in constrast to other
authentication frameworks which are built on top of Rails and Active Record,
Rodauth is implemented using Roda and Sequel. As a big fan of both libraries,
for me personally this was exciting, but at the same time I was worried this
meant Rodauth cannot be used with Rails. However, it turns out Rodauth can in
fact be used with any Rack-based web framework, including Rails.</p>

<p>Integrating Rodauth into Rails for the first time definitely wasn’t trivial,
but once all the kinks had been worked out, I extracted the necessary glue code
into <strong><a href="https://github.com/janko/rodauth-rails">rodauth-rails</a></strong>. It comes with generators, controller &amp; view
integration, mailer support, CSRF &amp; flash integration, HMAC security and more.
Additionally, to make Sequel coexist better with Active Record, I’ve created
the <a href="https://github.com/janko/sequel-activerecord_connection">sequel-activerecord_connection</a> gem, which enables Sequel to reuse Active
Record’s database connection. All this should make Rodauth as easy to get
started with as its Rails-based counterparts <img class="emoji" title=":muscle:" alt=":muscle:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4aa.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>And with its recent <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/2_0_0_txt.html">2.0 release</a>, it’s time to finally take a proper look into
Rodauth and see what makes it so special <img class="emoji" title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="encapsulated-authentication-logic">Encapsulated authentication logic</h2>

<p>As we’ve touched on before, what characterizes most Rails-based authentication
frameworks is that they implement their authentication behaviour directly on
the MVC layer. While this approach keeps things close to Rails, it also shoves
additional responsibilities into already-heavy Rails components, and generally
causes the authentication logic to be spread out across multiple application
layers.</p>

<p>With Rodauth, all authentication behaviour is encapsulated in a special
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rodauth::Auth</code> object, which is created inside a Roda middleware and has
access to the request context. It handles everything from routing requests to
Rodauth endpoints to performing authentication-related commands and queries.
We configure it as a Roda plugin and can we use it in Roda’s routing block to
perform any actions before the request reaches the main app. This design
enables us to keep our authentication logic contained in a single file.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">RodauthApp</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Roda</span>

      <span class="n">rodauth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">require_authentication</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we add the above Roda app to our middleware stack, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">route</code> block will
be called for each request before it reaches our main app, yielding the request
object. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r.rodauth</code> call will handle any Rodauth routes, while
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rodauth.require_authentication</code> will redirect to the login page if the session
is not authenticated. When the end of the routing block is reached, the request
proceeds onto our main app.</p>

<p>If you’re using Rails with rodauth-rails, the Rodauth instance will remain
available in your controllers and views as well, so you can do things like
require authentication at the controller level if you prefer to:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="n">before_action</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">rodauth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">require_authentication</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or render authentication links in the views:</p>

<div class="language-erb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">rodauth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">authenticated?</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">"Sign out"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rodauth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">logout_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">method: :post</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
  <span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">"Sign in"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rodauth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">login_path</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>

<span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are many more useful authentication methods defined on the Rodauth
instance that give us additional flexibility and introspection:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">rodauth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">auhenticated_by</span>                   <span class="c1"># e.g. ["password", "otp"]</span>

<h3 id="multifactor-authentication">Multifactor authentication</h3>

<p>In addition to the features above, Rodauth also provides <strong>multifactor
authentication</strong> functionality out-of-the-box, supporting multiple MFA methods
(<a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/otp_rdoc.html">TOTP</a>, <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/sms_codes_rdoc.html">SMS codes</a>, <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/recovery_codes_rdoc.html">recovery codes</a>, and <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/webauthn_rdoc.html">WebAuthn</a>). It includes complete
endpoints for setup, authentication, and disabling MFA methods, along with
the related HTML templates.</p>

<p>Here is an example setup that allows a user to enable TOTP verification for
their account, along with a backup SMS number and recovery codes (assuming
we’ve created the necessary <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/README_rdoc.html#label-Creating+tables">database tables</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/images/rodauth-otp-setup.png" alt="Rodauth TOTP setup page"></p>

<p>Having full-featured multifactor authentication built into the framework is a
game changer, as it means it will work well with other features and will remain
compatible with future Rodauth releases <img class="emoji" title=":raised_hands:" alt=":raised_hands:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f64c.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h3 id="json-api">JSON API</h3>

<p>Another cool feature of Rodauth is its built-in support for <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/jwt_rdoc.html">JWT</a> (short for
<a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a>), which provides token-based JSON API access for each
authentication feature. Here is how we can configure the JWT feature:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">RodauthApp</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Roda</span>

    <span class="n">jwt_secret</span> <span class="s2">"abc123"</span> <span class="c1"># 3) set secret for the JWT feature</span>
    <span class="n">require_login_confirmation?</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
    <span class="n">require_password_confirmation?</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now trigger Rodauth actions via a JSON requests, using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Authorization</code> header for authentication. Here is an example HTTP request for
account creation:</p>

<div class="language-http highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">POST</span> <span class="nn">/create-account</span> <span class="k">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Other authentication frameworks haven’t yet standardized JSON API support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Devise has multiple solutions (<a href="https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth">DeviseTokenAuth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/devise-jwt">Devise::JWT</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication">SimpleTokenAuthentication</a>)</li>
  <li>Sorcery currently has a few unmerged pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/pull/239">#239</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/pull/167">#167</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/pull/70">#70</a>)</li>
  <li>Clearance doesn’t currently support JSON (<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/issues/896#issuecomment-667257763">comment</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="uniform-configuration-dsl">Uniform configuration DSL</h2>

<p>If we look at how Devise is customized, we’ll notice there are several
different layers on which we can configure authentication behaviour: global
settings, model settings, controller settings, and routing settings. Some
of these settings can be configured dynamically (based on either model or
controller state), while other can only be configured statically. And some
before/after hooks are triggered on the model level, while for others you need
to override controller actions. This is pretty inconsistent <img class="emoji" title=":thumbsdown:" alt=":thumbsdown:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44e.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>In contrast, Rodauth provides a uniform configuration DSL that allows changing
virtually any authentication behaviour, which is all defined on the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rodauth::Auth</code> class. You can override a configuration method either by
providing a static value, or by passing a dynamic block that gets evaluated in
context of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rodauth::Auth</code> instance (and you can call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">super</code> to get original
behaviour).</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">RodauthApp</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Roda</span>

  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Internaly, Rodauth also provides a <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/guides/internals_rdoc.html#label-Feature+Creation+Example">DSL for writing new features</a>, which streamlines adding new configuration methods and encourages
making the feature behaviour as flexible as possible.</p>

<h3 id="hooks">Hooks</h3>

<p>Rodauth consistently provides hooks for virtually any action, which we can
override inside our configuration block. We can do something before/after
specific operations:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">after_login</span>           <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">remember_login</span> <span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>before specific routes:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">before_change_login_route</span>   <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">require_password_authentication</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<p>or before each Rodauth route:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="enhanced-security">Enhanced security</h2>

<p>When I would talk to people about Rodauth, one common concern was whether it’s
secure enough, given that alternatives such as Devise are more widely-used.
While I’m not qualified enough to provide a direct answer, what I can say is
that there are multiple indications that Jeremy takes Rodauth’s security very
seriously:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rodauth incorporates some <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/rodauth/#label-Security">additional security measures</a>
that are not common in other authentication frameworks (more on this below)</li>
  <li>Jeremy <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/rodauth/commit/18f26487c798cc5055cd5caf8bcafee1af719e3a">proactively patches</a> Rodauth when new
security issues are found in other authentication frameworks</li>
  <li>Jeremy’s <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyhack2018-ruby-web-application-security-defense-in-depth">talks</a> showcase some very advanced knowledge
on web application security</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tokens">Tokens</h3>

<p>Many authentication features (remembering logins, password reset, account
verification, email change verification etc.) generate random unique tokens as
part of their functionality. Since these tokens give permissions for performing
sensitive actions, we don’t want others having access to them.</p>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hmac_secret</code> is set (rodauth-rails sets it automatically), Rodauth will
sign the tokens sent via email using HMAC, while the raw tokens will be stored
in the database. This will make it so if the tokens in the database are leaked
(e.g. via an SQL injection vulnerability), they will not be usable without also
having access to the HMAC secret.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">hmac_secret</span> <span class="s2">"abc123"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For better bruteforce protection, Rodauth tokens also include the account id.
This way an attacker can only attempt to bruteforce the token for a single
account at a time, instead of being able to bruteforce tokens for all accounts
at once.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;account_id&gt;_&lt;random_token&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="protecting-password-hashes">Protecting password hashes</h3>

<p>Because cracking password hashes is always getting faster, to additionally
protect password hashes in case of a database breach, Devise and Sorcery enable
you to use a password <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)">pepper</a>, a secret key added to the password before it’s
hashed. This is pretty secure, provided that compromise of database doesn’t
also imply compromise of application secrets. A downside of peppers is that
they’re not easy to rotate, as changing the pepper would invalidate all
existing passwords stored in the database.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bcrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">pepper</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rodauth offers an alternative approach to protecting password hashes, which
relies on <strong>restricting database access</strong>. Password hashes are stored in a
separate table, for which the application database user has
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE access, but <em>not</em> SELECT access. This means an attacker
cannot retrieve password hashes even in case of an SQL injection or a remote
code execution exploit.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># full access by the app database user</span>
<span class="n">create_table</span> <span class="ss">:accounts</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">primary_key</span> <span class="ss">:id</span>
  <span class="no">String</span> <span class="ss">:email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">null: </span><span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">unique: </span><span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># *restricted* access by the app database user</span>
<span class="n">create_table</span> <span class="ss">:account_password_hashes</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">foreign_key</span> <span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:accounts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">primary_key: </span><span class="kp">true</span>
  <span class="no">String</span> <span class="ss">:password_hash</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">null: </span><span class="kp">false</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s great, but without the ability to retrieve password hashes, how is your
app then able to check whether an entered password matches the one stored in
the database on login? The answer: via a <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/rodauth/blob/40f9cd83e3bd2f10f44bca087c2c85bd9e3854fd/lib/rodauth/migrations.rb#L28-L38">database function</a>, which takes an account id and a password hash, and returns whether
the given password hash matches the stored password hash for the given account
id. This is effectively a limited SELECT query, but it’s all that’s needed for
login functionality, and it’s all the attacker gets in case of a database
breach.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">rodauth_valid_password_hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">123</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">"&lt;some_bcrypt_hash&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">-- returns true or false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can read about this in more detail <a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/README_rdoc.html#label-Password+Hash+Access+Via+Database+Functions">here</a>. Note that
this mode is completely optional, Rodauth works just as well with storing
password hashes in the accounts table; in this case it does password matching
in Ruby, just like we’re used to with other authentication frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="other-design-highlights">Other design highlights</h2>

<h3 id="decoupled-authentication-features">Decoupled authentication features</h3>

<p>Rodauth really did a great job in achieving loose coupling between its
authentication features. Additionally, each Rodauth feature is contained
<em>entirely</em> in a single file (and a single context), with the code being loaded
only if the feature is enabled. All this makes it significantly easier to
understand how each individual feature works.</p>

<h3 id="database-table-per-feature">Database table per feature</h3>

<p>Rodauth features are decoupled not only in code, but also in the database.
Instead of adding all columns to a single table, in Rodauth each feature has a
<a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/README_rdoc.html#label-Creating+tables">dedicated table</a>. This makes it more transparent which
database columns belong to which features.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rodauth is one of those libraries that come and renew my interest in the Ruby
ecosystem <img class="emoji" title=":heart_eyes:" alt=":heart_eyes:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60d.png" height="20" width="20"> Its advanced and comprehensive set of authentication
features (including multifactor authentication and JSON support), backed by a
powerful configuration DSL that provides immense flexibility, provide
overwhelming advantages over other authentication frameworks.</p>

<p>As someone who enjoys working in other Ruby web frameworks, I strongly believe
in focusing on libraries that are accessible to everyone. And Rodauth is the
first full-featured authentication solution that can be used in any Ruby web
framework (including Rails).</p>

<p>Hopefully this overview will encourage you to try Rodauth out in your next
project <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
