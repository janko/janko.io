I've just released version 3.0 of [Shrine], a gem for handling file attachments
in Ruby applications. It's been months of hard work, but I feel it's finally
ready.

## Redesigned website

The old Jekyll website has been [rewritten][docusaurus pr] to use
**[Docusaurus]**. :sparkles:

Docusaurus gives us nice features such as sidebars with autogenerated TOC and
related documents, which greatly improve navigation experience.

We also now have a snippet switcher, which makes it easier to show code for
different libraries.

  <img src="/images/shrine-website-switcher-c.png" alt="Shrine website snippet switcher C" width="600" />
</div>

Last but not least, we now have a documentation search bar powered by [Algolia
DocSearch].

## Major features

I've talked about the major changes in more detail [Upcoming Features in Shrine
3.0], but I'll give a brief overview here.

### Attacher redesign

The [`Shrine::Attacher`][attacher] class has been decoupled from the Active
Record pattern. It now supports handling attachments for immutable structs
(which are commonly used in Hanami, ROM, and dry-rb):

```rb
class Photo < Hanami::Entity # immutable struct
  include ImageUploader::Attachment(:image)
end
```
```rb
photo = photo_repository.find(photo_id)
photo.image #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>

attacher = photo.image_attacher
attacher.attach(file) # attach new file

photo_repository.update(photo_id, { image_data: attacher.column_data })
```

It can also be used standalone:

```rb
attacher = ImageUploader::Attacher.new
attacher.attach(file)
attacher.file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
attacher.url  #=> "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/image.jpg"
```

### Versions rewrite

The `versions` plugin is used for storing processed files alongside the main
file. Its implementation had many limitations, such as being coupled to the
attachment flow, mixing processed files and original file together, not being
able to specify different storage for processed files etc.

The new **[derivatives]** plugin is a rewrite of `versions`, offering an
explicit interface and the much needed flexibility.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :derivatives
```
```rb
class ImageUploader < Shrine
  Attacher.derivatives_processor do |original|
    magick = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original)

    { large:  magick.resize_to_limit!(800, 800),
      medium: magick.resize_to_limit!(500, 500),
      small:  magick.resize_to_limit!(300, 300), }
  end
end
```

Processing is now triggered explicitly:

```rb
photo = Photo.new(image: file)
photo.image_derivatives! # calls derivatives processor
photo.save
```

And processed data is saved separately from the original file:

```rb
photo.image             #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile @id="30733d04faceec5b.jpg" ...>
photo.image_derivatives #=>
# { large:  #<Shrine::UploadedFile @id="86500abe387b20b1.jpg" ...>,
#   medium: #<Shrine::UploadedFile @id="9e46ffbcca548290.jpg" ...>,
#   small:  #<Shrine::UploadedFile @id="f80fb04c3627c5a5.jpg" ...>, }
```

### Mirroring

The **[mirroring]** plugin has been added, which allows replicating uploads and
deletes to additional storage services. It's inspired by Active Storage and its
[mirror service][activestorage mirror service].

```rb
Shrine.storages = {
  cache: Shrine::Storage::S3.new(prefix: "cache", **s3_options),
  store: Shrine::Storage::S3.new(**s3_options),
  gcs:   Shrine::Storage::GoogleCloudStorage.new(**gcs_options),
}

Shrine.plugin :mirroring, mirror: { store: :gcs }
```
```rb
photo = Photo.create(image: file) # uploads main file to S3 and GCS
photo.image_derivatives!          # uploads processed files to S3 and GCS
photo.destroy                     # deletes files from S3 and GCS
```

You can also separate the mirroring operations into [background
jobs][mirroring backgrounding], so that they don't slow down the attachment
flow.

## Changes

For the full list of changes, see the [release notes]. If you're currently on
Shrine 2.x, there is a detailed [guide][upgrading guide] for upgrading to
Shrine 3.x.

### Plugins

The following plugins have been added :gift::

* [derivatives]
* [atomic_helpers]
* [model]
* [entity]
* [column]
* [mirroring]
* [multi_cache]
* [validation]
* [form_assign]

The following plugins have been deprecated :hand::

* `versions`
* `processing`
* `recache`
* `delete_raw`
* `module_include`

The following plugins have been removed :scissors::

* `logging`
* `moving`
* `copy`
* `backup`
* `hooks`
* `parallelize`
* `parsed_json`
* `delete_promoted`
* `multi_delete`
* `direct_upload`

### Gems

All official `shrine-*` gems have been updated to work with Shrine 3.0:

* [shrine-cloudinary]
* [shrine-flickr]
* [shrine-fog]
* [shrine-gridfs]
* [shrine-imgix]
* [shrine-mongoid]
* [shrine-sql]
* [shrine-transloadit]
* [shrine-tus]
* [shrine-uploadcare]
* [shrine-url]

### ROM & Hanami integration

As a result of the attacher redesign, Shrine 3.0 should now integrate better
with ROM and Hanami. I'm still wrapping up the [shrine-rom] gem, it should
hopefully get released in the next couple of days. :crossed_fingers:

## Conclusion

This has been the biggest Shrine release so far :open_mouth:. Shrine has been
on 2.x for the past three years, and during that time it became obvious that
some features weren't well designed.

Shrine's plugin architecture helped us a lot in addressing these, as it kept
features largely decoupled from one another. This made it easier to identify
issues and make changes, as we could work on one feature without affecting
others.

forum] if you have any troubles upgrading.
