You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight css %}
h1 {
  /* %extend .is-transitiony;
  @include clearfix; */
  font-size: 14px;
  background-image: url(some-url.png);
}
{% endhighlight %}
